            <p> Having spent my early years mostly in Pakistan and Northern Cyprus, I developed a strong sense of independence, adaptability and care for others. My childhood immersed in diverse cultures laid the foundation for a life of solo travel and service. In my youth, I lived in Mexico, the Sinai desert, Syria, Egypt and Ghana, teaching, volunteering and working with vulnerable populations. These experiences reinforced my calling to dedicate my life to caring for people. </p> <p> After studying Social Work at university and working directly with prison populations, at-risk youth and victims of trauma, I brought my passion for improving lives to the NHS. As a Senior Frailty Care Coordinator in East London, I have been instrumental in successfully implementing a new coordinated care model thanks to my personable communication abilities, tireless work ethic and organisational skills. My advocacy was recognised when the frailty care service received an excellence award. I aim to continue pursuing innovative projects that provide meaningful support and compassionately elevate the lives of the elderly. </p>
